After over two months of development, PHX V2 is finally nearing completion. This is a significant milestone for the PHX metaverse.

PHX V2 is a major upgrade that has the following advantages compared to V1:

1. Improved liquidity of funds, along with increased interaction with other DEFI protocols.
2. Significantly reduced lock-up time.
3. Supports compounding, resulting in higher yields.
4. Completely new UI, which is more streamlined and user-friendly.
