# IDO

:::tip IDO is already finished.
:::

In order to provide sufficient liquidity on Dex (Swappi) during the launch of PHXPool V2, we will raise a certain amount of CFX through IDO before the launch of PHXPool V2 according to the following rules:

* IDO amount: 1000,000 PHX
* IDO price: 1 PHX = 0.1 CFX
* Single purchase limit: 10,000 PHX
* IDO block chain: Conflux eSpace
* IDO start time: 2023-06-25 10:00:00 UTC (block height 73,960,109)

All raised CFX will be used to provide PHX/CFX trading liquidity.

## How to participate in IDO

Participation is very simple, just send CFX directly to the IDO contract address, which is [`0x38c5BF398Ed531d5D1297D4c4E2043efA09564dc`](https://evm.confluxscan.org/address/0x38c5bf398ed531d5d1297d4c4e2043efa09564dc). After the transaction is successful, you will receive the corresponding amount of PHX.

**Attention: Please check if the PHX balance of the IDO contract is 0 before sending. If it is 0, it means that the IDO has been sold out. Also, please make sure the target address is correct.**
