# Restake Reward

To incentivize user participation in staking, the PhxVerse protocol has introduced a restake reward mechanism. Users can stake their **cMon** tokens or **LP** tokens into staking pools to earn additional staking rewards.

This mechanism is a form of our operational promotion, where incentives of various sizes are distributed at different stages. For example, we will hold extensive reward campaigns when the Monad LSD goes live.
