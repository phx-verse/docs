# RoadMaps

This is the roadmap for the PHXVerse. It is a living document and will be updated as we progress.

1. PHX Pool v2, PHX and LPs farming; launch new PHXVerse website
2. sWCFX: a modern version of WCFX with PoS rewards.
3. Expand the PoS pool to other networks
4. Push forward integration PHX, cCFX, sWCFX with other DeFi protocols: [Swappi](https://swappi.io/), [Goledo](https://www.goledo.cash/), vSwap, etc.
5. Bootstrap PHX DAO to govern the PHXVerse
6. Develop [DVT (Distributed Validator Technology)](https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/understanding-distributed-validator-technology-dvt/) for Conflux Network PoS to improve the security of Conflux network

Stage 1 should be complete in three weeks.
